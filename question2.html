<p>The Ashoka Stambhs, or Pillars of Ashoka, are a series of monolithic columns erected by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka between 268 and 232 BCE. After witnessing the brutality of the Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and dedicated his reign to spreading its moral and ethical teachings, known as Dharma. The pillars were a key part of this effort, acting as lasting monuments to his reformed rule</p>
